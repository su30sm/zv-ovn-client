deprecations:
  - |
    The ``--class`` options of the ``quota show`` and ``quota set`` commands
    are now deprecated. Quota classes were never fully implemented and the
    compute and volume services only support a single ``default`` quota class
    while the network service does not support quota classes at all. The
    default quotas can be changed on a deployment-wide basis via configuration
    and can be inspected using the ``openstack quota show --default`` command.
    Quotas can still be set on a project-specific basis using the ``quota set``
    command.
