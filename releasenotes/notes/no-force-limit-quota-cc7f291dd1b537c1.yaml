features:
  - Add ``--no-force`` option to the ``openstack quota set`` command (only
    for compute and network commands). When specified, the compute and network
    quota engine will check the resource usage before setting the new quota
    limit. This is the default behavior of the compute quota engine and will
    become the default for the network quota engine in a future release.
deprecations:
  - The ``openstack quota set`` command currently defaults to ``--force``
    behavior for network quotas. This behavior is now deprecated and a future
    release will switch to ``--no-force`` behavior. Users should explicitly
    specify one of these options to prevent a potentially breaking change in
    behavior.
