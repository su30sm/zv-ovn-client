    Added two new filter flags to ``openstack network qos rule type list``:
    ``--all-supported``, to return any QoS rule type supported by at least
    one loaded driver; ``--all-rules``, to return all QoS rule types
    supported by the current version of Neutron server, regardless of the
    loaded drivers.
