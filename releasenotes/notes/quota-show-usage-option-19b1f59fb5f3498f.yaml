features:
  - |
    The ``quota show`` command now supports a ``--usage`` option. When
    provided, this will result in the command returning usage information for
    each quota. This replaces the ``quota list --detail`` command which is now
    deprecated for removal.
deprecations:
  - |
    The ``--detail`` option for the ``quota list`` command has been deprecated
    for removal. When used without the ``--detail`` option, the ``quota list``
    command returned quota information for multiple projects yet when used with
    this option it only returned (detailed) quota information for a single
    project. This detailed quota information is now available via the
    ``quota show --usage`` command.
  - |
    The ``--project`` option for the ``quota list`` command has been deprecated
    for removal. Use the ``quota show`` command instead.
